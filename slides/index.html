Arrow functions are anonymous functions that use an "arrow" __=>__. The syntax for arrow functions comes in many variations.
All variations begin with _function arguments_, followed by the _arrow_, followed by the _body_ of the function.
Both the arguments and the body can take different forms depending on usage.
    
__Single argument.__ When there is only one argument for an arrow function, it can be used directly without any parentheses.
The expression to the right of the arrow is evaluated and returned.
    
ES6
    
```ts
[1, 2, 3].map(num => num * 2);
```
    
ES5 equivalent
    
```js
[1, 2, 3].map(function(num) {return num * 2;});
```
    
No `return` keyword is required with a single statement.

---
    
# Arrow functions. Syntax (2/4).
    
__More than one argument.__ You must include parentheses around the arguments if there are more than one argument.
    
ES6
    
```js
var sum = (num1, num2) => num1 + num2;
```
    
ES5 equivalent
    
```js
var sum = function(num1, num2) {
  return num1 + num2;
};
```
    
__No arguments.__ You must include parentheses if there are no arguments (the same syntax as for many arguments).
Example of a function that does nothing:
    
```js
var doNothing = () => {};
```
    
---
    
# Arrow functions. Syntax (3/4).
    
__More than one statement in the body.__ If you want to have some other statements and not just an expression to return,
you have to use brackets.
    
ES6
    
```js
[1, 2, 3, 4].map(num => {
  var multiplier = 2 + num;
  return num * multiplier;
});
```
    
ES5 equivalent
    
```js
[1, 2, 3, 4].map(function(num) {
  var multiplier = 2 + num;
  return num * multiplier;
});
```  
    
__Note:__ When a function has multiple arguments and multiple statements, there are no significant differences with
a named function declaration.
    
---
    
# Arrow functions. Syntax (4/4).
    
There is a special case - an arrow function that wants to return an object literal `{...}`. In this case,
the function body must wrap the literal in parentheses.

ES6
    
```js
var getSomeObject = id => ({key: id, value: "unknown"});
```
    
ES5 equivalent
      
```js
var getSomeObject = function(id) {
  return {
    key: id,
    value: "unknown"
  };
};
```
    
Wrapping the object literal in parentheses signals that the braces are an object literal instead of the function body.
    
---
    
# Arrow functions. IIFEs.
    
Immediately-invoked function expressions (IIFEs) allow you to define an anonymous function and call it immediately without saving a reference.
    
```js
let person = function(message) {
  return {
    getGreeting: function() {
      return message;
    }
  };
}("Hell World!");
```
    
To accomplish the same thing using arrow functions, you have to wrap the arrow function in parentheses.
    
```js
let person = ((message) => {
  return {
    getGreeting: function() {
      return message;
    }
  };
})("Hell World!");
```

# Arrow functions. Lexical binding (1/5).
    
The value of `this`, `super`, `arguments` inside of the arrow function is determined by the closest containing nonarrow function.
In other words, the value of `this`, `super`, `arguments` is determined by where the arrow function is defined and not where it is used.
It is said that arrow functions are bound to their _lexical scope_.
    
The value of `this` inside of the arrow function __can't be changed__ due to the lexical binding.
It remains the same value throughout the entire lifecycle of the function.
That also means, `.call` and `.apply` won't be able to change the value of `this`.
    
There are a few reasons for these differences. The lexical scope reduces errors and ambiguities inside of arrow functions.
By doing so, JavaScript engines are better able to optimize arrow function execution.

You can say goodbye to `var self = this` and similar hacks, such as using `.bind(this)`, to preserve the context
within deeply nested methods.
    
---
    
# Arrow functions. Lexical binding (2/5).
    
ES5 with `self`
    
```js
function Timer() {
  var self = this;
  self.seconds = 0;
    
  setInterval(function() {self.seconds++;}, 1000);
}
```    
    
ES6
    
```js
function Timer() {
  this.seconds = 0;
    
  setInterval(() => this.seconds++, 1000);
}
```
    
---
    
# Arrow functions. Lexical binding (3/5).
    
ES5 with `.bind(this)`
    
```js
var SomeObject = {
  init: function() {
    document.addEventListener("click", (function(event) {
      this.doSomething(event.type);
    }).bind(this), false);
  },

  doSomething: function(type) {...}
};
```
    
ES6
    
```js
var SomeObject = {
  init: function() {
    document.addEventListener("click",
      event => this.doSomething(event.type), false);
  },

  doSomething: function(type) {...}
};
```
    
---
    
# Arrow functions. Lexical binding (4/5).
    
__Quiz__. Will this code work?
    
```js
var controller = {
  makeRequest: (...) => {
    // ...
    this.helper(...);
  },
    
  helper: (...) => {
    // ...
  }
};

controller.makeRequest(..);
```

--
    
__Answer__: No.
    
The `this.helper` reference fails, because `this` here doesn't point to `controller`.
It lexically inherits `this` from the surrounding scope and `this` in the surrounding scope points to the global scope!
The global scope doesn't have the method `helper`.
    
---
    
# Arrow functions. Lexical binding (5/5).

Arrow functions don't have their own `arguments` object, but it's possible to access the `arguments` object from a containing function.
    
```js
function createArrowFunction() {
  return () => arguments[0];
}

var arrowFunction = createArrowFunction(5);
    
console.log(arrowFunction());  // 5
```
    
Last but not least: arrow function cannot be used as a constructor and will throw an error when used with `new`.
    
```js
var MyType = () => {};
    
var object = new MyType();  // error
```

---
    
# Block-level functions. Strict mode.
    
In ECMAScript before 6, a function declaration inside of a block led to a different behavior in browsers,
so it is considered a best practice to avoid function declarations inside of blocks.
In ECMAScript 6, block-level functions were standardized.
    
```js
"use strict";
    
if (true) {
  console.log(typeof doSomething);  // "function"
    
  function doSomething() {
    ...
  }
    
  doSomething();
}
    
console.log(typeof doSomething);  // "undefined"
```
    
In the strict mode, block level functions are hoisted to the top of the block in which they are defined.
Once the `if` block finished executing, `doSomething()` no longer exists.
    
---
    
# Block-level functions. Non strict mode.
    
ECMAScript 6 also allows block-level functions in non strict mode, but the behavior is slightly different.
Instead of hoisting these declarations to the top of the block, they are hoisted to the containing function or global environment.
    
```js
if (true) {
  console.log(typeof doSomething);  // "function"
    
  function doSomething() {
    ...
  }
    
  doSomething();
}
    
console.log(typeof doSomething);  // "function"
```
    
In this example, `doSomething()` is hoisted into the global scope so that it still exists outside of the `if` block.
ECMAScript 6 standardized this behavior to remove the incompatible browser behaviors that previously existed,
so all ECMAScript 6 runtimes should behave in the same way.
